# Fridge WIP

WIP Android application by pyamsoft

# Work in Progress

## Development

WIP is developed in the Open on GitHub at:  
```
https://github.com/pyamsoft/fridge
```
If you know a few things about Android programming and are wanting to help  
out with development you can do so by creating issue tickets to squash bugs,  
and propose feature requests for future inclusion.`

# Issues or Questions

Please post any issues with the code in the Issues section on GitHub. Pull Requests 
will be accepted on GitHub only after extensive reading and as long as the request 
goes in line with the design of the application. Pull Requests will only be 
accepted for new features of the application, for general purpose bug fixes, creating 
an issue is simply faster.
