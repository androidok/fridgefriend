        FridgeFriend has the optional ability to remind you about items you still need to shop for when you are near a supermarket.

        \n\nIn order to do this however, it requires access to your Location whenever the App is in use.

        \n\nFind and select nearby stores on the map, and them save them as favorites by clicking the star icon. FridgeFriend will
        remind you in the future whenever you are near one of your favorite stores about the items you still need to purchase.
